* Q-functions: bug in o_q ?

* add more examples/description/ tests 

* Create a new 26 branching rule.

* Code cleaning:
	- still some variable declarations in blocks
	- still some memory leak (some may be detected by heapstatus and some not) ?

* trap signal 
	- to interrupt long calculation and be able to save current state...

* Maple, SAGE, etc. output
	Some code exists for Maple output, but it must be checked

* library form
	convert schur in a library (at least partially).

* Graphical interface
	to be OS independant may use a web browser and consider Schur as a kind of local web server
        producing MathML output (for example).

* Convert the manual bibliography into BibTeX format.
	there is 159 entries actually in the bibliography, and all entries are not called in the text
	refresh bibliography as well

* include manual directory into autoconf system 
	- not important, partially done

* Introduce some priorities in this TODO list !
